## Background

CoE in partnership with OPM, is modernizing the Federal Annuity Claims Expert System (FACES). Retirement Services (RS) is the OPM program division responsible for the administration of retirement benefits. RS staff members depend on FACES to adjudicate about 80,000 federal retirement benefit actions every year. FACES is a reliable and accurate system, but it was built with tools that are no longer supported by the manufacturer, which makes it difficult to update and maintain. FACES wasn’t originally designed as enterprise software and there is limited documentation that describes how FACES works. Also, there is no disaster recovery plan in place in case the application suffers critical failure. Legal Administrative Specialists (LAS) depend on FACES to do their jobs. Their retirement benefits expertise is essential to the adjudication of cases, but making up for the legacy app’s shortcomings forces them to squander time and focus. 

OPM is replacing both the FACES desktop app and the calculator that the app relies on to determine retirement benefits. The app replacement and the calculator replacement are separate projects, but the teams supporting each will communicate regularly. Both projects will begin at roughly the same time, but the Government expects to complete the replacement app well in advance of the replacement calculator. Early in the process, the Contractor responsible for the replacement calculator will supply the app replacement team with application program interface (API) specifications.  

## Purpose

The purpose of the OPM Calculator Replacement contract is to replace the current calculator with a calculation service. Rather than replicating an approach based on formulas, the service will introduce a system for managing business rules that, when applied, will result in calculations. The calculator will be wrapped in an Application Programming Interface (API) that will provide access for the FACES app, as well as for applications created outside of OPM. The current FACES app and its replacement must both access the new calculation service.
