## Background

GSA’s Centers of Excellence (CoE), in conjunction with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is introducing a calculation service as part of the larger effort to modernize the retirement benefits system for federal employees.

Retirement Services (RS) is the OPM program division responsible for the administration of retirement benefits. To determine benefits today, RS staff members depend on a calculator that is reliable and accurate, but was built with technology that is no longer supported by its manufacturer. Business rules are expressed as hard-coded formulas that exist inside and outside of the calculator. Updating the calculator is laborious and inefficient as a result.

## Purpose

The purpose of this contract is to replace the current calculator with a calculation service. The service will contain all the calculations required to compute the amount of money a federal retiree should receive. The service will be capable of accepting queries from any authorized app via an application program interface (API), calculating a benefit based on a set of business rules and returning a dollar amount via API. It will be one of OPM’s first modern, independent services and it will serve as an example of, and model for the agency’s modernization efforts.
